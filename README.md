# mc2brs

mc2brs is a Minecraft world to Brickadia savefile conversion tool.

## Installation and Usage

You can install the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/kmschr/mc2brs/releases) tab. The tool will look for your Minecraft worlds in the standard installation folder, and will output converted saves in whatever folder it's being ran from. It is reccomended for ease of use to create a `mc2brs` folder in your Brickadia builds folder (located in `AppData/Local/Brickadia/Saved/Builds`) and run the tool from there.

## Compatibility

mc2brs is generally compatible with every Minecraft Java Edition world started in 1.14 or later, though there may be some issues if the world was converted from an earlier version or if a world editing tool such as MCEdit or WorldPainter was used. It has been tested on snapshot `21w18a`. Support for Bedrock Edition may be added at a later point.
